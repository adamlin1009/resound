# Resound Codebase Comprehensive Audit Plan

## Phase 2 Implementation Progress (Last Updated: 6/9/2025)

### Completed Fixes:
1. **Removed Console Statements** ✅
   - Removed all console.log/error/warn from 25 production files
   - Replaced with appropriate comments for future reference

2. **Fixed Memory Leaks** ✅
   - Fixed Toast component setTimeout cleanup issue
   - Fixed RateLimiter global setInterval cleanup
   - Added proper cleanup in useEffect returns

3. **Replaced TypeScript 'any' Types** ✅
   - Fixed 15+ critical 'any' types in data access layer
   - Replaced with proper Prisma types (Prisma.ListingWhereInput, etc.)
   - Fixed error handling to remove 'any' type annotations
   - Updated component props to use specific interfaces

### Remaining High Priority Tasks:
1. **Consolidate Modal State Management** (4 duplicate stores → 1 generic or URL params)
   - useLoginModal, useRegisterModal, useRentModal, useSearchModal have identical structure
   - Could save ~60 lines by using URL params or single generic store
2. **Standardize Error Handling** (create consistent error format)
   - 15 files use generic "Internal server error" messages
   - Need consistent error response format across all APIs
   - Create custom error classes with codes
3. **Add Missing Error Boundaries** (most route segments lack error.tsx)
   - Only root error.tsx exists with empty useEffect
   - Need error.tsx in each route segment

### Remaining Medium Priority Tasks:
1. **Extract Magic Numbers to Constants**
   - Timeout values (3000ms in Toast)
   - Pagination limits (20, 100 in getListings)
   - Other hardcoded values scattered in code
2. **Fix Missing useEffect Dependencies**
   - MessagesClient.tsx has intentionally omitted dependencies
   - useMediaQuery hook has unnecessary dependencies
3. **Split Large Components**
   - RentalManageClient.tsx (643 lines)
   - RentModal.tsx (507 lines)
   - getListings.ts (260 lines)
4. **Replace Client State with Server State**
   - useMessages store (195 lines) duplicates server state
   - Could use React Query/SWR instead

### Remaining Low Priority Tasks:
1. **Remove Unused Exports**
   - formatMessagingExpiry in messagingUtils.ts never used
2. **Remove ClientOnly Wrapper**
   - Duplicates Next.js built-in functionality
   - Use dynamic imports with ssr: false instead
3. **Optimize Polling in Messages**
   - Polls every 5 seconds regardless of tab visibility
   - Should use Page Visibility API
4. **Fix Import Typo**
   - ListingClient.tsx imports useLoginModel (should be useLoginModal)

### Code Reduction Potential:
- ~300 lines still identified for removal (excluding Toast)
- Console statements removed across 25 files ✅
- TypeScript type safety improved significantly ✅
- Memory leaks fixed in 2 components ✅

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive audit plan for the Resound classical instrument rental marketplace codebase. The audit aims to ensure production readiness with zero vulnerabilities while adhering to all code quality, engineering, and security guidelines. Using ultrathink and deepthink methodologies, this plan provides a systematic approach to evaluating security, performance, scalability, maintainability, and overall code quality.

## Audit Scope

### In-Scope Components
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.3 App Router implementation, React components, client-side state management
- **Backend**: API routes, server actions, authentication flows, payment processing
- **Database**: MongoDB with Prisma ORM, data models, queries, indexes
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment configuration, environment variables, third-party integrations
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, rate limiting
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, test coverage analysis
- **Documentation**: Code comments, README files, API documentation

### Out-of-Scope
- Third-party service configurations (Stripe, Cloudinary, Google APIs)
- External infrastructure (hosting platform, CDN)
- Historical code commits (focus on current state)
